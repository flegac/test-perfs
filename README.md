# test-perfs
This project is about testing two sort of optimisations.
It was created to illustrate a presentation to my collegues about Data Oriented Programming (DOP).

#malloc
This test shows the gain of performance when allocating in batch versus allocating many small objects.

#data oriented
This test compare two implementations of the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture.
The first use the classic Object Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm.
The second one use Data Oriented Programming (DOP).

WARNING: if tests are taking too loog on your computer just change the number of instanciated objects.
